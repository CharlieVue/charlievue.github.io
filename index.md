<h2>Self Introduction:</h2>

<p> Hello person who is reading this website, my name is Charlie Vue and I am a Computer Science Major and I will be graduating in Spring 2022. My career goal is to work somewhere in Software Development or Database Management. My hobbies are reading web novels, watching anime, and playing games. My email is <b> charlievue@csus.edu. </b> 

<p> One topic that really intrigues me is the topic on AIs. I would love to learn how AIs are developed and what capabilities they will have in the future. Will we reach a discovery where AIs can think and have conscience like us, humans? I really like this topic because it presents a moral and controversial topic that will be debated for many years in the future. If AIs can become human-like are we playing God by being their creator or are we going to treat them like a real living human being that is next to us. Hopefully, one day I will be able to see that technology and historical moment come to life. One of my favorite articles about AI can be found here at: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/12/10/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-humans/"> AIs </a></p>
